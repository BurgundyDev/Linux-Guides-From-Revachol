# Linux Guides From Revachol
A set of Linux guides on more or less advanced topics concerning Linux.

## Introduction
Over the course of my, at this point, over 5-year long adventure with GNU/Linux I've become completely addicted to distrohopping, and with that came a lot of configuring the same stuff over and over and over again. While having automated scripts for that does often help and a local backup of configs is a large help, it does not give rationale for certain things, isn't 100% foolproof and, most of all, is not universal. I need different elements added to my .zshrc depending on the distro, DE and situation, so keeping different copies of the same file would be neccessary for any of the aforementioned solutions to work.
Another thing I needed was a way to share knwoledge with new people I got into Linux so that they may get info on the basics fast and from a reliable and easy-to-access source.
Lastly - all the knowledge on different cofiguration elements for my Linux installs are scattered over forum posts, reddit threads and Telegram messages, making them extremely difficult to access. This is a way of unifying information in one place so that it can be easily accessed and commented on in real time.

###### With those things in mind - I've comprised the Linux Guides From Revachol.

## Structure
These guides are simple Markdown files for ease of use - a single file concerns a singular topic. They are categorized into folders which can also have subfolders if such a need arises. They are all written from the perspective of Arch users but unless otherwise specified **should** work regardless of Distribution. If that is not the case, feel free to get in touch. Distribution Specific tips and tweaks have their own folder and per-distro subfolders.
